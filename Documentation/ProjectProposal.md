## **Team project proposal**

Goal: Develop an AI Chatbot to assist Morgan computer science students

Target audience: Enrolled computer science students then eventually expand to include other SCMNS students, prospective students, and more.

Objective summary: Creating an AI Chatbot specifically for Morgan State, computer science will allow current students to have 24/7 access to ask about anything within the CS department. With the developing chatbot, students will be able to get information on various topics which will include the following: course descriptions/coursework, information about graduate programs, homework help, connect with staff members, student advice/concerns/suggestions, and more.

Functionality: Our chatbot will be capable of providing instant responses to common questions related to the computer science department. The queries will range from questions about the computer science department. If time allows, we will include general questions about computer science topics like programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. A knowledge base consisting of online resources, and tutorials will be integrated to provide answers to the queries.

Feedback Mechanism: A thumbs up or thumbs down emoji will be included after queries to ask the user if the chatbot answers were helpful.

Project Approach:

1. Utilize existing chatbots (ChatGPT, AWS, Microsoft CoPilot) to develop a chatbot framework
2. Gather training data to build the dialogue flow between the bot and the user
3. Research Morgan State University branding guidelines
4. Make front-end changes including Morgan State University branding logos, colors, & font
5. Conduct testing
6. Work on final demo presentation
