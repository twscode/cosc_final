## **Progress Report 1**

So far, the team has met twice to discuss the project. We have two ongoing individual team member tasks which are the following: research suggested existing chatbots frameworks (ChatGPT, AWS, Microsoft CoPilot), and gather training data. After the meetings, the following team tasks were completed: set group meeting times, discuss team project proposal, and establish a project approach. Also, we decided to make revisions to the project proposal.

The goal will still be to develop an AI Chatbot to assist Morgan computer science students. However, the target audience will be specifically for enrolled computer science students then eventually expand to include other SCMNS students, prospective students, and more.

The objective is to create an AI Chatbot specifically for Morgan State computer science students that will allow current students to have 24/7 access to ask about anything within the CS department. With the developing chatbot, students will be able to get information on various topics which will include the following: course descriptions/coursework, information about graduate programs, homework help, connect with staff members, student advice/concerns/suggestions, and more.

For the functionality, the chatbot will be capable of providing instant responses to common questions related to the computer science department. The queries will range from questions about the computer science department. If time allows, we will include general questions about computer science topics like programming languages, algorithms, and data structures. A knowledge base consisting of online resources, and tutorials will be integrated to provide answers to the queries. To gather feedback the chatbot will include a thumbs up or thumbs down emoji after queries to ask the user if the chatbot answers were helpful.

Lastly, the team plans to use the following project approach in the upcoming weeks ahead:

1. Utilize existing chatbots (ChatGPT, AWS, Microsoft CoPilot) to develop a chatbot framework
2. Gather training data to build the dialogue flow between the bot and the user
3. Research Morgan State University branding guidelines
4. Make front-end changes including Morgan State University branding logos, colors, & font
5. Conduct testing
6. Work on final demo presentation
